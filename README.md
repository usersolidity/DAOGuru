## Decentralized Business Enabler and Growth Platform for DAOs 

**DAO Guru is a platform that makes it easy for DAOs to run businesses by providing their products, services, and subscriptions in a decentralized manner. The future of governance is DAO and DAO Guru will help organizations with key functionalities to run businesses like:**


**DAO Escrow:**  By DAO Escrow, DAOs can set up escrow agreements with other DAOs or individuals and as per the payment terms, funds will get locked from the buyer’s account to DAO Guru to smart contract and once the seller submits the delivery and its acceptance by the buyer, the smart contract will release the fund from smart contract to seller’s account.

**Subscription service:**  DAOs can create their periodic subscription service and accept recurring payments from their clients. We have used a superfluid service to stream subscription payments from buyers to sellers.
